# 100-DaysOfCoding-Part2
Doing another 100 days of coding after finishing the first one and failing the second attempt at day 45 during the end of July

Day 1 (6th August)
- Starting a big recap of everything I've leant so far

- went through HTML and CSS today

Day 2

- went over JS and advanced JS notions

**Day 3**
- continuing recap
- starting work on the portfolio (again)
- going over some ethical hacking notes I took last year

Stopped coding for a while, got caught up with life and University. Did some minor programming these last few weeks, recaping knowledge

Date: 18 October

Day 1
- Javascript exercises and coding problems to revise some concepts
- won a hackathon from Nasa last weekend where I've also created a website with Boostrap in less than two days, put it live and all that.
- attended meetings on Artificial Intelligence last week
- today went to a DeepLearning meetign regarding OCR for Invoices and Music Production through machine learning (lots to learn)
- tomorrow is a meeting on the Worldcoin project started by Sam Altman

**Restarting**
Date: 14th November

**Day 1:**
- last week finished a fancy menu bar exercise, didn't update in time
- today worked on a music player in JS, moving through songs

**Day 2:** 
- innertText creates a reflow
- finished the music app
- decided to put the songs info into a json file
- created async functions

**Day 3:**
- debugged a bit because of some json paring errors
- finally did it it with object.keys and object.values
- on first load the song wouldn't change it's original name and would throw an error declaring that my json variables are undefined
- realized the async nature of my functions and that the fetch triggers after the loadFunction, created a setTimeout

**Day 4 til Day 8**
- didn't get a change to update here each day
- started custom countdown project, completed it 
- decided to added another function to custom countdown, main page where you can dynamically create new countdowns
- still have to implement logic for retrieving each countdown and adding to the main page
- setTimeout, async functions, JSON, local storage and cookies

**Day 8 (22th November)**
> added remove button for divs in local storage

> figured out the logic for keeping track of the containers created, their key in Local storage and updating it when items are removed

> modified logic so that every container is checked inside the storage with a foor loop

> modified html structure, added new design in css

> solved the dynamic layout size, min and max height

> finished the Ui for main page, dynamic creation of divs and allocation to local storage

**Day 9 to Day **
- finished countdown app, need to add details
- started nextjs project

**Day **
- day at Digital Sunray office, worked on creating a dynamic mobile add in JS
- spent half of the day working on the project, mostly CSS and dynamic JS, transitions, keyframes, media queries and so on
